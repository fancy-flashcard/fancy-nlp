# Fancy NLP

As simple as it gets.

## How it works
1. check the [_train.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/_train.REST)file to see how to trigger NLP Training
2. check the [_get-response.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/_train.REST) file to see how to get a response (replace your client id by the result of step 1)
