# Fancy NLP

As simple as it gets.

## How it works
1. check the [_train.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/test-on-productive-server/_train.REST) file to see how to trigger the NLP Training
2. check the [_get-response.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/test-on-productive-server/_get-response.REST) file to see how to get a response (replace your client id by the result of step 1)
3. check the [_get-messages.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/test-on-productive-server/_get-messages.REST) file to see which messages where responded to how (replace your client id by the result of step 1)
4. check the [_get-balance.REST](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/fancy-nlp/blob/master/test-on-productive-server/_get-balance.REST) file to check the balance and the fundings of a client (replace your client id by the result of step 1)
